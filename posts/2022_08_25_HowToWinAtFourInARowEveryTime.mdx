# How to Win at 4 in a Row Every Time
4 in a row is an easy game to learn but difficult to master. In this guide, we'll teach you all the rules of 4 in a row and some of the best strategies for winning. The game can be played by two or four players, and it's suitable for all ages--it's a lot of fun! However, we'll only be covering the two-player version of the game. Whether you're just starting out or you're looking for ways to improve your gameplay, we're sure you'll find some great tips and tricks throughout this guide to beat your opponent!

## 4 in a Row Rules
The rules of the game are simple. The goal is to be the first player to get four of your disc pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game is played on a rectangular grid, typically with seven columns and six rows. Players take turns dropping their pieces into the grid, until the person connects four first. If the grid fills up before either player has 4 in a row, then the game ends in a draw.

To start playing, each player chooses a color for their pieces. Then, the players decide who will go first--a game of rock, paper, scissors is a common way to do this. Each player can only take one turn per round. Pieces fall straight down and cannot be moved after they are placed. So, if you missed your chance to get 4 in a row or to prevent your opponent from snatching the win, then you'll have to wait until the next round.

## Strategies for Winning
Before you start going through the various strategies, you need to keep in mind that there is no perfect strategy for winning this game. The best you can do is try to come up with a plan that will give you the best chance of winning, and then hope that your opponent doesn't have a better plan. You must also adapt to the situation as the game progresses, as 4 in a row is a game of both offense and defense. One simple move from your opponent may force you to rethink your entire strategy. Regardless of the strategy you choose, you'll want to plan multiple moves ahead so that you're always one step ahead of your opponent. The same goes for anticipating their moves.

With that being said, here are some tips and strategies to help you win.

## Playing the Middle Columns
A popular strategy to get 4 in a row is to focus on playing the middle columns. This gives you the most options to build your base and block your opponent. It can be difficult for your opponent to stop you if you're constantly playing in the middle, so this is a great way to play offensively and put some pressure on them. One variation of this strategy is to start in the middle and then move to the outer columns as the game progresses. This can be a good way to surprise your opponent and catch them off-guard, as it gives you more opportunities for a diagonal win later on.

## Playing the Corners
Another strategy is to focus on playing the corners--either the very left or right or one column closer to the middle. This can be a smart way to take control of the grid and play for the win during the middle to later phases of the game. You'll also have more opportunities to prevent your opponent from getting 4 in a row. Overall, playing the corners can set up a diagonal win or take more control of the upper half of the grid, which is advantageous as the board starts to fill up. Playing the corners will be more difficult than playing the middle, but it can be a clever way to also catch your opponent off-guard.

## Blocking Your Opponent
One of the most important aspects of 4 in a row is to prevent your opponent from connecting four. This can be done by playing defensively and keeping an eye on their moves. If you see that they're close to getting 4 in a row, then try to block them by playing in the same column or row. It can also be helpful to try to set up a 4 in a row of your own while you're blocking your opponent, as this will give you a better chance of winning the game. You need to be able to anticipate your opponent's moves well if you plan on blocking them effectively.

## Set up a Double Win or Trap
If you're feeling really ambitious, then you can try to set up a double win or trap. This is where you set the grid up so that your next move will let you win in two different ways. For example, you could play in a way so that you could either get 4 in a row horizontally or 4 in a row diagonally. This can be a difficult task, but if you pull it off then it's guaranteed that you'll win the game. Just be careful not to let your opponent find an opportunity to sneakily set up a double win on you instead.

Setting up a trap is similar, where you set the grid up so that your opponent will be forced to play in a way that benefits you. For example, you could set it up so that they have to block one of your 4 in a row, which would then give you another chance to connect four. This is also a difficult strategy to pull off, but it can be very effective if done correctly. You'll need to be thinking several moves ahead in order to set up a trap effectively. Plan far so that you can bait your opponent into putting pieces down exactly where you need them so that you can get closer to connecting your real 4 in a row.
