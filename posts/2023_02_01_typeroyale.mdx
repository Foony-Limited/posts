# How to win at TypeRoyale.
In this guide, we'll give you some tips and tricks so you can improve your typing speed and accuracy to start beating your opponents in TypeRoyale.

## Touch Typing
Touch typing means typing without looking at the keys. Each finger is assigned a set of keys to type. The little bumps on your keyboard on the F and J keys are used to keep track of where the keys are. Simply place your left index finger on the F key and your right index finger on the J key and the rest of your fingers will be in the correct position. The starting position is called the "home row". From there you can easily reach the top or bottom row. With some practice, touch typing can greatly improve your typing efficiency as looking at the keys to find the right letters is very time-consuming.
Use all of your fingers to type

# Use All or Most of Your Fingers to Type
This will decrease the travel distance for each finger and make your typing faster and more comfortable. If you find it particularly uncomfortable to use your pinky fingers it's fine to use your ring finger instead. It's up to you to decide which finger to use for the spacebar. It is considered easier to just use one thumb for the spacebar as opposed to two since you won't have to think about which finger to use depending on the situation.

## Practice regularly
Practicing is the best way of improving your typing speed. To improve your typing speed, it's important to type frequently. It's better to practice typing a little bit every day, as opposed to doing a long typing-practice session once a week. Each day when you sleep your brain will process what you learned. Therefore, by typing daily you'll improve more quickly. Typing practice makes the most sense once you're warm. You should practice the most in the stage after warm-up and before fatigue. (edited)

## Take breaks
Typing fast doesn't just require a physical effort but also mental effort. Make sure not to type for too long as it will cause your forearms to get exhausted and your focus will decrease which will cause you to make more mistakes. Too much typing, in the worst case, can even cause injuries to your hands, so make sure to type in moderation.

## Focus on Accuracy
Not making mistakes while typing is of great importance. Typing more doesn't magically make you faster at typing. If you make a mistake, then you're more likely to make that mistake in the future again. You are reinforcing a bad habit. The same applies to typing a word correctly. If you type a word correctly you are more likely to type it correctly again the next time you type it.
