# How to Play
The goal of the game is to "Checkmate" the opponent's king.

The white pieces go first.

You only move a single piece per turn.

When it’s your turn, click (or drag) a piece to select it, and then click on one of the guide dots that
appear to move it there, or on a red highlighted tile to move and take the piece that is
there.

You can't move your king into check.

You must resolve a check if you are in check.

**Check:** A check is when a king is able to be taken on the next turn by a piece.<br />
**Checkmate:** A checkmate occurs when a king is unable to move out of check<br />
**Stalemate:** A stalemate occurs when there are no legal possible moves.<br />
**Promoting:** When a pawn gets to the other side of the board, it can be promoted into any other non-king piece.

# Piece Movement
**Pawns:** Can only move forward a single tile, but can move two tiles if it's their first time moving. Pawns can only attack pieces if they are diagonally in front of it.<br />
**Knights:** Can move in an "L" shape pattern—two tiles in a vertical or horizontal direction, and then another space in a ninety-degree angle. The knight piece is not blocked by occupied tiles.<br />
**Rooks:** Can move infinitely in horizontal and vertical directions, but not through occupied tiles.<br />
**Bishops:** Can move infinitely in diagonal directions, but not through occupied tiles.<br />
**Queens:** Can move infinitely in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions, but not through occupied tiles.<br />
**Kings:** Can only move a single space in any of the nine surrounding directions.
